# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The ArcQubit team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you find.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)**
   - Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send an email to: **security@arcqubit.io**
   - Include detailed information about the vulnerability
   - PGP key available upon request

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us better understand and address the issue, please include:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability and potential attack scenarios

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

| Severity | Initial Response | Status Update | Fix Timeline |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | 24 hours | Every 48 hours | 7-14 days |
| **High** | 48 hours | Weekly | 14-30 days |
| **Medium** | 5 business days | Bi-weekly | 30-60 days |
| **Low** | 10 business days | Monthly | 60-90 days |

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt within the timeframes above
2. **Validation**: We'll validate and triage the vulnerability
3. **Updates**: Regular status updates on our progress
4. **Disclosure**: We'll work with you on responsible disclosure timing
5. **Credit**: We'll publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Update Policy

### Supported Versions

We release security patches for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

### Security Advisories

Security advisories are published at:
- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner/security/advisories)
- Project documentation: [docs/security/](docs/security/)

### Automated Security Scanning

This project uses multiple security tools:

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis security testing (SAST)
- **Cargo Audit**: Rust security advisory database checks
- **OpenSSF Scorecard**: Weekly supply chain security assessment
- **Secret Scanning**: Detects accidentally committed secrets

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this project, please:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Run `cargo update` regularly
2. **Run Security Checks**: Use `cargo audit` before submitting PRs
3. **Follow Secure Coding Guidelines**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
4. **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**: Use environment variables
5. **Sign Commits**: Use GPG-signed commits when possible

## Security Considerations for PQC Scanner

### Cryptographic Scanning

This tool analyzes code for quantum-vulnerable cryptography. Key security considerations:

1. **False Positives**: The scanner may flag legitimate uses of classical crypto
2. **Scope**: Focuses on cryptographic library detection, not runtime behavior
3. **Privacy**: All scanning is performed locally; no code is transmitted externally

### WASM Security

When using the WASM version:

- WASM modules run in a sandboxed environment
- No network access or file system access from WASM
- Input validation is performed before WASM execution

### Supply Chain Security

We maintain supply chain security through:

- **Cargo.lock committed**: Ensures reproducible builds
- **Dependency review**: All dependency updates reviewed by maintainers
- **SBOM generation**: Software Bill of Materials included with releases
- **Signed releases**: All releases cryptographically signed with Sigstore
- **SLSA Provenance**: SLSA Build Level 3 attestations for all artifacts

#### Verifying Signed Releases

All PQC Scanner releases are cryptographically signed using [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/):

```bash
# Install cosign
brew install cosign  # macOS
# or: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/

# Download release and signature
wget https://github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner/releases/download/v2025.11.0/pqc-scanner-2025.11.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner/releases/download/v2025.11.0/pqc-scanner-2025.11.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sigstore.json

# Verify signature
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle pqc-scanner-2025.11.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v2025.11.0" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  pqc-scanner-2025.11.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

Expected output: `Verified OK`

#### Verifying SLSA Provenance

All releases include [SLSA Build Level 3](https://slsa.dev/) provenance:

```bash
# Install slsa-verifier
wget https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/releases/download/v2.6.0/slsa-verifier-linux-amd64
sudo mv slsa-verifier-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/slsa-verifier
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/slsa-verifier

# Download provenance
wget https://github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner/releases/download/v2025.11.0/multiple.intoto.jsonl

# Verify provenance
slsa-verifier verify-artifact \
  --provenance-path multiple.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner \
  pqc-scanner-2025.11.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

Expected output: `Verified SLSA provenance`

#### Verifying Container Images

Docker images are signed and attested:

```bash
# Verify image signature
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  ghcr.io/arcqubit/pqc-scanner:2025.11.0

# Verify SBOM attestation
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type spdxjson \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/arcqubit/pqc-scanner/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  ghcr.io/arcqubit/pqc-scanner:2025.11.0
```
